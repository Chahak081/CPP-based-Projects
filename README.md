# Miniature-Root-Optimiser
This is an efficient application made as a group project in CPP based on Delhi metro to find the shortest path between two stations .



This repository contains a miniature root optimizer implemented in C++ using object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts and data structures such as graphs, Dijkstra's algorithm, and priority queues. 

Getting Started
To get started with the root optimizer, follow the steps below:

1.Clone the repository to your local machine:
2.Navigate to the project directory:
3.Build the project using your preferred C++ compiler
4.Run the optimizer:

 

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts-
The root optimizer utilizes the following OOP concepts:

1.Encapsulation
2.Abstraction
3.Inheritance



Data Structures
The root optimizer uses the following data structures:

1.Graphs
2.Dijkstra's Algorithm
3.Priority Queue
