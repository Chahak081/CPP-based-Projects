This repository consists of folders consisting of CPP codes as explained in readme futher.

# Miniature root optimiser-
This is an efficient application made as a group project in CPP based on Delhi metro to find the shortest path between two stations .



This repository contains a miniature root optimizer implemented in C++ using object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts and data structures such as graphs, Dijkstra's algorithm, and priority queues. 

Getting Started
To get started with the root optimizer, follow the steps below:

* Clone the repository to your local machine.
* Navigate to the project directory.
* Build the project using your preferred C++ compiler.
* Run the optimizer

 This project has the following dependencies:
 * Visual Studio Code Installer - To run the code

 

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts-
The root optimizer utilizes the following OOP concepts:

* Encapsulation
* Abstraction
* Inheritance



Data Structures
The root optimizer uses the following data structures:

* Graphs
* Dijkstra's Algorithm
* Priority Queue



# Tic-Tac-toe game using CPP
* Easy to use fun-game and made easy with minimum functions ans easy concepts
